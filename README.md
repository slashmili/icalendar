A small library for reading and writing ICalendar files.

# This library is in maintenance mode

Bug fixes may be accepted but no new features will be added. If you wish to add
new features I recommend creating and publishing a fork. If an active fork is
created I will direct users from this project to the new one.

## Installation

The package can be installed by adding `:icalendar` to your list of dependencies
in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:icalendar, "~> 1.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Usage

```elixir
events = [
  %ICalendar.Event{
    summary: "Film with Amy and Adam",
    dtstart: {{2015, 12, 24}, {8, 30, 00}},
    dtend:   {{2015, 12, 24}, {8, 45, 00}},
    description: "Let's go see Star Wars.",
    location: "123 Fun Street, Toronto ON, Canada"
  },
  %ICalendar.Event{
    summary: "Morning meeting",
    dtstart: DateTime.utc_now,
    dtend:   DateTime.shift(DateTime.utc_now, hour: 3),
    description: "A big long meeting with lots of details.",
    location: "456 Boring Street, Toronto ON, Canada"
  },
]
ics = %ICalendar{ events: events } |> ICalendar.to_ics
File.write!("calendar.ics", ics)
